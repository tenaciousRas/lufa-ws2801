===============================================================

 This software was written in XCode using OBDev's AVR-LIB toolchain for OS X
 (http://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html) and thus compiles with avr-gcc.

 It has been tested on an the AdaFruit ATMega32u4 breakout 
 (http://www.adafruit.com/products/296) with Sparkfun's WS2801 breakout
 (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10504).

 To Build:
 First(!) set the symbolic link named "LUFA" at the top level of this project.  
 This should point at the /LUFA folder in the LUFA library. 

 This is a typical avr-gcc project that uses Make.  Edit the Makefile with your 
 programmer and port.  See the Makefile for additional notes.

 Once Makefile has been configured, enter the following UNIX commands compile and program:
cd [path-to-lufa-ws2801]/firmware
make
make program
